Created the `ExpressionReader` interface and its concrete implementation `GrammarExpressionReader`. Did the work
behind reading expressions and evaluating them correctly. In addition, implemented utility class `Functions` that 
works like the static `Math` class, in that it supplies functions that can be called on by the expression reader.
