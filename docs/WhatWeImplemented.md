Created the `SpreadsheetGUI` class which makes it so that you are able to view, edit, and resize the spreadsheet.
You are also able to add formulas to the cells and be able to see the evaluated value while not editing the 
current cell. If you are editing the cell, you will see the originally enter item (whether that be a formula, 
string, integer, etc.).

Created the `ExpressionReader` interface and its concrete implementation `GrammarExpressionReader`. Did the work
behind reading expressions and evaluating them correctly. In addition, implemented utility class `Functions` that 
works like the static `Math` class, in that it supplies functions that can be called on by the expression reader.
